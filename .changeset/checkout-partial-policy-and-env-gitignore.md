Apply a `neon.ts` policy as part of creating a branch, so a rejected setting can't leave a half-configured branch behind — and keep pulled dotenv files out of git.

`createBranch` used to create the branch and then push the policy onto it, so a setting Neon rejected (a plan-gated compute value, an out-of-range autoscaling limit) failed *after* the branch existed: the branch stayed behind, `.neon` was never pinned, no env was pulled, and re-running `neon checkout` silently accepted the half-configured branch because checkout never reconciles a branch that already exists. Everything the policy can express in the create call — `parent`, `ttl`, `protected`, and compute settings — now rides along on it, and Neon validates the request as a whole, so a rejected value fails with no branch created and the API's own error. `result.applied` still reports those settings, described exactly like the changes a push applies, so folding them into the creation doesn't make them disappear from the summary (`neon checkout` prints them as a `parent → main` / `ttl → …` / `computeSettings.autoscalingLimitMaxCu → 2` diff).

Services — Neon Auth, the Data API, buckets, and functions — are provisioned against an existing branch id and have no create-time equivalent, so that window stays open. It is now typed: `createBranch` throws `PartialBranchCreateError` (exported from `@neon/config` with `branchId` / `branchName` / `reason`, plus an `isPartialBranchCreateError` guard), and `neon checkout` uses it to pin the branch and pull its env before failing with the cause and both recovery paths (`neon deploy --update-existing`, or delete and check out again for a policy keyed on `!branch.exists`).

`neon env pull` — including the pull bundled into `link` / `checkout` / `deploy` — now adds a dotenv file it creates to `.gitignore`, the same way the `.neon` context file is handled, so a live `DATABASE_URL` isn't one `git add -A` from being committed. Nothing is appended when an existing pattern such as `.env*` or `*.local` already covers the file, and a dotenv file that already existed is left alone.
