Make `neon` the package that carries the Neon CLI implementation, and turn `neonctl` into a lightweight compatibility package that depends on `neon` and runs its CLI entry point. `neonctl` keeps providing both the `neonctl` and `neon` commands, so installing it — including via Homebrew — behaves exactly as before, and now also downloads `neon`.
