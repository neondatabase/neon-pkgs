# neonctl

## 2.29.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [b78ced2]
  - @neon/env@0.9.0

## 2.29.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `neon config init`: scaffold a starter `neon.ts` policy and install the Neon config packages (`@neon/config` + `@neon/env`), detecting the project's package manager. Also offer it as the final step of an interactive `neon link` (then pull env so the local `.env` reflects the new policy).

## 2.28.0

### Minor Changes

- f13ce14: Add `neon status` and the `--current-branch` flag for `config status`.

  `neon status` is a top-level alias for `neon config status` (it mirrors all of its options and delegates to the same handler).

  `config status --current-branch` (also `neon status --current-branch`) prints only the branch pinned in the local `.neon` file with no network request, no login, and no analytics — cheap enough to drive a shell prompt (e.g. starship). It prints the branch name to stdout and exits 0; when no branch is pinned it prints nothing to stdout, writes a `neonctl checkout <branch>` hint to stderr, and exits non-zero (grep-style) so a prompt can guard on the command directly.

### Patch Changes

- Migrate neonctl off the deprecated axios-based `@neondatabase/api-client` to a fetch-native client over `@neon/sdk`. `axios` and `axios-debug-log` are removed; API failures now surface as a single `NeonApiError`; `HTTP(S)_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` support is preserved (via undici) and the per-request timeout + 423 retry are unchanged. Also bumps the bundled `@neondatabase/config`, `@neondatabase/config-runtime`, and `@neondatabase/env` to 0.8.1 (the @neon/sdk-based releases). Requires Node >=22.

## 2.27.1

### Patch Changes

- 68a080f: Republish `neonctl` from the `neon-pkgs` monorepo (`packages/cli`). The CLI source has moved from `neondatabase/neonctl`; no functional changes.

## 2.27.0

### Moved into the monorepo

- Migrated the Neon CLI source from [`neondatabase/neonctl`](https://github.com/neondatabase/neonctl) into `neon-pkgs` as `packages/cli`. No functional changes — still published as `neonctl` with the `neonctl` and `neon` binaries.
