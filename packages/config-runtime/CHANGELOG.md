# @neondatabase/config-runtime

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release of `@neondatabase/config-runtime` — the imperative runtime for `@neondatabase/config`. Reads a branch's live state, diffs a policy against it, applies changes, and bundles + deploys Neon Functions. Function bundling pulls in `esbuild`, so this is the package CLIs and CI import — keeping `esbuild` out of the dependency tree of anyone who only imports `defineConfig` from `neon.ts`.

  - `inspect` / `plan` / `apply` (Terraform-style), plus the lower-level `pushConfig` / `pullConfig` engine.
  - Preview features are applied **additively** (buckets and functions are created and the AI Gateway is enabled; nothing is auto-deleted), and `inspect` / `pullConfig` reports a branch's live Preview state.
  - `buildFunctionBundle` — bundles a function's `source` with esbuild and zips it for deploy.
